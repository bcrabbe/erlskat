# Skat Rules (International Skat Order, 3 Players)

## Bidding

After the deal, a **bidding auction** determines the *declarer* (soloist) who plays against the other two (defenders). Bids are numerical game values (minimum 18, maximum 264) that the bidders promise to achieve.  Forehand (player left of dealer) starts by naming a value or passing.  Middlehand then may “hold” (accept) that bid or raise to a higher value, or pass.  If Forehand passes initially, bidding proceeds between Middlehand and Rearhand in the same way.  The players alternate bidding until only one holds the highest bid.  The player who **offers or accepts the highest bid becomes declarer**.

1. Forehand vs. Middlehand: Forehand bids a value; Middlehand may pass or name a higher value. If Middlehand holds a bid, Forehand can raise or pass, etc.
2. Next stage: The remaining highest bidder then bids with the third player.  For example, if Forehand and Middlehand bid, the winner now auctions with Rearhand (dealer) under the same rules.
3. If Forehand and Middlehand both pass without a bid, Forehand must play (and may pick up the skat or declare a Hand game).  If all three players pass on opening bids, the hand is “passed in” (redealt).

Once bidding ends, the highest bidder is the declarer.  He must then immediately **declare his contract** (suit, Grand, or Null, and any Hand/Ouvert declarations) equal to or above his bid.  (The bid itself already represents the required game value; see Scoring below.)  All bids and passes are final and cannot be retracted.  During bidding, no one may look at the face‐down Skat or others’ cards; if a player illegally exposes the Skat or another’s cards, he is barred from further bidding.

## Color (Suit) Game

In a **Suit game** (called a *color* game), the declarer chooses one suit (Clubs, Spades, Hearts or Diamonds) as trump.  All **four Jacks are always trumps**, in the fixed order Club > Spade > Heart > Diamond.  They are the highest trumps in any suit game.  After the Jacks, the remaining cards of the declared trump suit rank in descending order: Ace, 10, King, Queen, 9, 8, 7.  Each of the other three suits (non-trump suits) has no further hierarchy over each other; within each non-trump suit the ranking is Ace, 10, King, Queen, 9, 8, 7 (the Jack of that suit is already counted among the trumps).

* **Trump Determination:** Declarer names a suit as trump.  All Jacks plus all cards of that suit are trump.  Example: if Hearts is trump, then {J♣, J♠, J♥, J♦, A♥, 10♥, K♥, Q♥, 9♥, 8♥, 7♥} are the 11 trumps.
* **Card Ranking:** The order of cards (highest to lowest) is:

  * **Trumps:** J♣ (highest), J♠, J♥, J♦, then A of trump, 10, K, Q, 9, 8, 7.
  * **Non-trump suits:** In each other suit the order is A > 10 > K > Q > 9 > 8 > 7.

Play of the hand then proceeds in tricks. Forehand leads the first trick, and play continues clockwise.  Players **must follow suit** if they have a card of the led suit; if not, they may play any card or a trump.  Tricks are won by the highest trump played, or if no trump is played, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads the next.  The **declarer** plays alone against the two defenders (opposition). To win the contract, the declarer must score at least 61 of the total 120 card points (including the two skat cards). (Card-point values: Ace=11, Ten=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2, 9/8/7=0.) If the declarer fails to reach 61 points (i.e. defenders reach 60 or more), he loses the game.

## Grand Game

A **Grand game** is similar to a color game except **only the four Jacks are trumps**【29†L125-127】.  No additional suit is trump.  The trump order is the same fixed suit order of Jacks (Clubs > Spades > Hearts > Diamonds).  All other cards are non-trump and rank in their suits as Ace, 10, King, Queen, 9, 8, 7【29†L125-127】.  (The Jack in each suit counts as a trump instead of being part of that suit’s run.)

* **Trump:** Only J♣, J♠, J♥, J♦ are trumps (in that priority).
* **Card Ranking:** In each suit, card ranking is A > 10 > K > Q > 9 > 8 > 7.  For example, in Clubs (when Clubs is non-trump), A♣ is highest club, then 10♣, K♣, Q♣, 9♣, 8♣, 7♣ (there is no J♣ in this sequence because J♣ is a trump).
* **Play:** Trick-taking rules are the same as above (must follow suit, highest trump or highest card of suit wins).  The declarer (soloist) holds the Jacks as only trumps; strategy focuses on controlling these.

The **game value** of a Grand is calculated like a suit game but with base value 24 (instead of 9–12 for suits).  Grand games (and Grand Hand/Grand Ouvert) bid from 24 upward.  The declarer still needs 61 card points to win, and if he fails the Grand contract he loses double the game value (see Scoring).  Thus the logic of play is the same as in suit games, except the smaller number of trumps alters strategy.

## Null Game

In a **Null game**, the goal is entirely reversed: **no tricks should be won by the declarer**.  There are **no trumps**.  All Jacks are treated as ordinary cards in their suits.  The card ranking in each suit is altered to: Ace (highest), then King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7 (lowest)【29†L128-129】.  (Notably, the Jack ranks just above the 10 and below the Queen.)

* **Objective:** The declarer *loses* if he wins any trick. To win a Null contract, he must take **zero tricks**.
* **Hand and Ouvert:** The declarer may declare a Null Hand (no skat pickup) or Null Ouvert (hand played face-up) to increase the base value, but this does not change the win condition – still 0 tricks.  (For example, the base values are: Null 23, Null Hand 35, Null Ouvert 46, Null Hand Ouvert 59.)
* **Play:** Forehand leads first. All players must follow suit if possible. Because there are no trumps, the highest card of the suit led wins each trick. The declarer will play carefully to void suits and shed his high cards. Any trick he takes immediately dooms the contract.

If the declarer avoids all tricks, he wins the Null game; otherwise he loses.  There is no 61-point threshold – taking even one trick is an immediate loss.  (In effect, the defenders aim to force a trick on declarer, while he tries to avoid it.)

## Scoring System

Each game’s **value** is calculated and recorded when play ends.  The **base value** depends on the contract: Diamonds=9, Hearts=10, Spades=11, Clubs=12, Grand=24.  (Null contracts have fixed values: Null=23, Null Hand=35, Null Ouvert=46, Null Ouvert Hand=59.)  The final **game value** = *base value* × *multiplier*, where the multiplier is determined by special conditions:

* **Tops (Spitzen):** Count the number of top trumps the declarer holds in an unbroken sequence from J♣ downward.  The multiplier always starts at 1 plus the number of Tops.  (“With X” tops effectively gives a factor of X+1.)
* **Hand game:** If the declarer plays **Hand** (does not pick up the Skat), add +1 to the multiplier.
* **Schneider / Schwarz:** If the declarer wins so that the defenders score ≤30 points (Schneider), add +1. If the defenders score 0 (Schwarz), add +1 more.
* **Announcements:** If in a Hand game the declarer **announced** Schneider or Schwarz *and* achieved it, each announced level adds +1. (If he announced but fails, he loses the game; see below.)
* **Ouvert:** In suit and Grand games played **Ouvert** (declarer’s hand exposed), this counts as Hand + Schneider + Schwarz + announcements all in one, effectively adding +6 to multiplier (see example below).

Thus for suit or Grand games, the multiplier = 1 (base) + Tops + Hand + Schneider (actual) + Schwarz (actual) + Schneider announced + Schwarz announced + Ouvert.  (In practice Ouvert normally implies the last four conditions, giving multiplier = 7 + Tops.)  In Null games the value is fixed as above and does not use a multiplier formula.

**Example (suit game):** Declarer plays Clubs (base=12), has 2 Tops, plays Hand, and wins with Schneider (announced) but not Schwarz.  Multipliers: 1 (base) + 2 (tops) + 1 (Hand) + 1 (Schneider actual) + 0 (Schwarz) + 1 (Schneider announced) = 6.  Game value = 12×6 = 72.
**Example (Grand Ouvert):** Declarer has all 4 Jacks (4 tops) and plays Ouvert.  Multipliers: 1 + 4 (tops) + 1 (Hand) + 1 (Schneider) + 1 (Schneider announced) + 1 (Schwarz) + 1 (Schwarz announced) = 10 (since Ouvert also implies Schwarz announced).  Game value = 24×10 = 240.  (The official example gives Grand Ouvert with 4 Jacks as 24×11=264 – that implies counting Ouvert as +7 beyond base, which matches 1+4 (tops)+6 (all bonuses) = 11.)

**Winning vs Losing:** If the declarer **wins** his contract, he scores +(*game value*). If he **loses**, his score is –2×(*game value*) (a double penalty).  All bonuses (Schneider, Schwarz, etc.) count only if achieved; announcing and failing Schwarz/Schneider means an immediate loss at that (or higher) level.  For Null games, a win yields the fixed value (e.g. +23), and a loss yields –(2×value) similarly.

All scores are recorded on the score sheet.  In effect, the declarer earns the computed game value for a win and loses double it for a loss.  (The defenders do not gain points in a won game; their success is simply preventing the declarer from scoring.)
